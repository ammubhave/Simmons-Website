        <h1>Housing Policy</h1>
        <h2>Simmons Transfers</h2>
        <p class="p2">Between the fall and spring terms, the Housing Office
          will conduct a dormitory readjustment lottery for students
          transferring in and out of Simmons and communicate the results to
          the RACs. In addition, throughout the semester, the Housing Office
          may assign students to Simmons as vacancies arise. As students are
          assigned to Simmons, the RACs should assign them to rooms. These
          assignments are left to the discretion of the RACs, with the general
          guidelines that these assignments should be appropriate to the class
          year of the incoming student. Any student assigned to a room in this
          manner <u>may not</u> squat their room in the house-wide spring
          lottery.</p>
        <h2>Mini Lotteries</h2>
        <p class="p2">Each semester, after Registration Day, the RACs should
          conduct a Semester Readjustment Lottery. This lottery is designed to
          allocate any rooms which have opened due to withdrawals/transfers
          which have not been assigned to incoming students. If there are no
          such rooms, the RACs may elect not to hold the lottery. This lottery
          is open to any Simmons resident, though residents do not have to
          enter.</p>
        <p class="p2">Students who elect to enter the lottery will have their
          selection order determined by a public, manual drawing. Residents
          may observe the lottery, though they do not have to be present. The
          priorities will be those of the house-wide Spring Lottery: Seniors,
          9+ Term, Juniors, Sophomores, and Freshmen.</p>
        <p class="p2">No sooner than the day following the selection order
          lottery, the RACs will hold the room selection process. When it is a
          student's turn, he may choose an open room (a single or unoccupied
          double) or he may remain in his room. If he chooses an open room, he
          is assigned to the chosen room and his old room is added to the list
          of open rooms (unless his old room is now a singly-occupied double).
          Once all the open rooms have been claimed, the lottery is closed.</p>
        <h2>Room Swaps</h2>
        <p class="p2">Students may swap rooms during a term. Everyone involved
          in the swap &mdash; including any roommates &mdash; must email the
          RACs &lt;<span id="email_rac_swap">Address Obscured</span>&gt; to
          confirm that they approve of the swap. Once the RACs have approval
          from everyone, they will notify the entire house body by emailing
          the official housing mailing list
          &lt;<span id="email_official_swap">Address Obscured</span>&gt; to
          announce the proposed swap. Any resident then has twenty four hours
          to lodge any objections. These objections will be kept confidential,
          and if they are sufficient the swap will be refused. If there are no
          objections, the swap will go through and the students must move into
          their new rooms as soon as possible.</p>
        <script type="text/javascript">
          make_addr_span("email_rac_swap","simmons.mit","edu","racs");
          make_addr_span("email_official_swap","simmons.mit","edu","official");
        </script>
        <h2>Special Circumstances</h2>
        <p class="p2">If students have conflicts or extenuating circumstances
          and need to move into a single or another room, the request must
          come from MIT Medical, MIT Counseling, or the Simmons House Team,
          comprised of the Simmons Housemasters and Associate Housemasters. No
          personal requests will be considered. Resolution of these issues is
          left to the house team and the RACs. Any student assigned to a room
          in this manner may not squat that room in the house-wide spring
          lottery.</p>
        <h2>House-Wide Spring Lottery: Selection Order Process</h2>
        <p class="p2">The house-wide spring lottery is designed to allocate
          rooms for the following academic year. It should occur as soon as
          possible following confirmation of the final housing lists from the
          Housing Office.</p>
        <p class="p2">Two weeks before the room selection weekend, students
          may declare blocks. Any residents may block together, irrespective
          of gender or class year. The individual rankings of each resident in
          a block will be averaged together to give the ranking of the block.
          When the block's turn comes, each member of the block will pick
          their room sequentially, in the order of their original ranking. In
          the event of a tie in the rankings, preference goes to the
          individual over the block, and the smaller block over the larger.
          All blocks must be declared <u>by midnight</u>, the day before the
          selection order lottery, and are final once the selection order
          lottery has begun. No one may exit a block by squatting.</p>
        <p class="p2">One week before the room selection weekend, the RACs
          should conduct the selection order lottery. This lottery <u>must</u>
          be public, though residents do not have to attend. Preferences in
          the lottery are:</p>
        <ol class="p2">
          <li>Resident Seniors</li>
          <li>Transferring Seniors</li>
          <li>Resident 9th Term</li>
          <li>Transferring 9th Term</li>
          <li>Resident Juniors</li>
          <li>Transferring Juniors</li>
          <li>Resident Sophomores</li>
          <li>Transferring Sophomores</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p2">The selection order lottery will establish the picking
          order within each of these broad groups. Once the lottery has been
          run, the RACs will publish the overall order.</p>
        <p class="p2">The preferred method of conducting the selection order
          lottery is to have the names of all the students from a respective
          group be drawn from a hat. Once a slip is drawn, the pick number
          should be written on the slip in ink. The RACs then repeat this
          process for all 8 groups until all the names have been drawn. At the
          end of the lottery, the name slips must be preserved until the
          completion of the room selection process.</p>
        <h2>Room Squatting:</h2>
        <p class="p2">With a few exceptions, residents may squat their current
          rooms. If a resident declares a squat, they are removed from the
          lottery and assigned to their current room. Squats may be declared
          until the moment that another resident selects that room, though
          residents are asked to declare them as soon as possible.
          Declarations of squats are irrevocable. Students who were assigned
          to their rooms by the RACs may not squat their rooms. Additionally,
          the twenty-five smallest doubles are reserved for freshmen and may
	  not be selected in the lottery or squatted by their current
	  residents.</p>
	<p class="p2">Additionally, anyone who has swapped rooms since the
	  last April/May Simmons internal lottery process may not squat their
	  room in the next lottery process.  September/January internal
	  processes are not to be considered swaps for the purposes of this
	  rule; they are legitimate lottery-based rooming switches.</p>
        <h2>House-Wide Spring Lottery: Room Selection Process</h2>
        <p class="p2">On the room selection weekend, the RACs will proceed in
          order of the published rankings. Each student will be given one
          minute to select their room. If a student does not select a room in
          the period, or is not present at all, they will be dropped to the
          bottom of their group (i.e. Resident Seniors or Transferring
          Sophomores) and the RACs will move on to the next name on the list.
          At the end of each group, the RACs will announce the absent
          students. If the student again misses their turn, they will be
          dropped to the end of the lottery (i.e. after the transferring
          sophomores).</p>
        <p class="p2">The list of residents will be broken into blocks of
          fifty students, with one hour allocated to each block of fifty. A
          block of fifty may start after the allocated hour, but will not
          begin before that time.</p>
        <p class="p2">When a student's turn comes, he may pick any open room
          he wishes. If he selects a double, he may immediately designate a
          roommate. If he designates a roommate, the roommate is assigned to
          the room and removed from the lottery. If he does not choose a
          roommate, the slot remains open and will not be filled without the
          student's approval. If necessary, at the end of the lottery or
          during the Freshman Rooming Lottery, a student may be assigned to
          the open slot if no other openings are available.</p>
        <p class="p2">If a resident is unable to attend the physical selection
          period, he may designate a proxy to choose instead. This proxy may
          be another student, who is given the power to choose a room for the
          resident, or the RACs. If the RACs are chosen to act as a proxy, the
          resident should submit a preference sheet, indicating the
          rooms/characteristics he would prefer. Anyone who declares a proxy
          must abide by the proxy's decision. Notification of intent to use a
          proxy must be emailed to the RACs
          &lt;<span id="email_racs_proxy">Address Obscured</span>&gt; no later
          than midnight the day before the room selection process.</p>
        <script type="text/javascript">
          make_addr_span("email_racs_proxy","simmons.mit","edu","racs")
        </script>
        <p class="p2">The RACs should reserve rooms in the lottery for
          incoming CMI students as well as students returning from a leave of
          absence. These students should be considered transferring seniors
          and should be added to the end of the transferring seniors group.
          The RACs should select the largest rooms then available for these
          students, with a preference for scattering them throughout the
          building.</p>
	<p class="p2">Fifty doubles, including the smallest twenty-five doubles
	  in the building, should be reserved for incoming freshmen.  The
	  twenty-five smallest doubles may not be chosen in the spring
	  lottery, and may not be squatted.  The remaining twenty-five doubles
	  reserved for freshmen shall be the last twenty-five not chosen in the
	  spring lottery.  Once all except twenty-five doubles (excluding the
	  twenty-five smallest) have been chosen, no student may choose an
	  empty double, and no student may squat one of the remaining
	  doubles.</p>
        <p class="p2">After the lottery has been run and the final housing
          list has been received from the Housing Office, residents who desire
          to may swap rooms. These swaps must be approved by everyone
          involved, including roommates, and must be published to official and
          given 24 hours to clear. Any swap involving a resident who cancels
          his housing before move-in will be nullified and all residents
          returned to their original rooms. Room swaps for the fall semester
          are <u>not</u> conducted over the summer vacation. Therefore,
          students have until the last day of class (Spring Semester) to
          request a swap. After this, students wishing to swap rooms for the
          fall must wait until after Registration Day, fall semester.</p>
        <p class="p2">The RACs take no responsibility for maintaining or
          verifying bathroom gender preferences. If a resident has a strong
          aversion to sharing a bathroom with a given gender, it is that
          resident's responsibility to pick an appropriate room.</p>
        <p class="p2">In special circumstances, it may become necessary for
          RACs to assign a student to a specific room. These requests must
          come from counseling or medical and have been approved by the
          Simmons House Team. These requests do not need to be made public and
          are not open for discussion. Resolution of specific situations is
          left to the RACs and house team.</p>
        <h2>Summer Rooming:</h2>
        <p class="p2">The Housing Office will provide a list of students
          assigned to Simmons for the summer. The RACs will assign each
          student to a room for the summer. Because of the temporary nature of
          these assignments as well as the time restriction between the list
          publication and end of spring term, no lottery will be held and
          specific assignments are left to the discretion of the RACs.</p>
        <p class="p2">Seniors who are staying until graduation may stay in
          their rooms until they leave. Seniors who will be remaining for the
          rest of the summer may stay in their rooms as long as those rooms
          are available for the entire summer. For all other students,
          priority is given first to students who can move into their fall
          assignments. The next priority is for students remaining in their
          spring assignment. If neither of these conditions is met, preference
          is given to a nearby room of the appropriate size.</p>
        <p class="p2">If a student's fall assignment is occupied by a senior
          who is leaving after graduation, that student should be given a
          temporary assignment in the closest proximity to their fall
          assignment as possible. Once the senior leaves, the student may move
          into their fall assignment. No other switches will be allowed after
          graduation.</p>
        <h2>Freshman Rooming:</h2>
        <p class="p2">Over the summer, the Housing Office will provide a list
          of freshman who have been assigned to Simmons. The RACs will be
          responsible for matching these freshman as well as writing a welcome
          letter. The freshmen should be paired such that all roommate
          requests are honored, and beyond that at the discretion of the RACs,
          with the understanding that these assignments are temporary and much
          of the necessary information is lacking.</p>
        <p class="p2">Once the freshmen have received their permanent
          assignments to Simmons, the Freshmen Room Assignment process should
          take place. First priority goes to upperclassmen who selected
          doubles but not roommates in the House-Wide Spring Lottery. If these
          upperclassmen can find a mutually agreeable roommate among the
          freshmen, the freshman is removed from the remainder of the rooming
          process and assigned to the upperclassman's room. Failing this,
          preference sheets will be distributed to each freshman.</p>
        <p class="p2">The priorities of the RACs will place the happiness of
          the freshmen collectively over the happiness of any individual
          freshman. Using their best judgment and the results of the
          preference sheets, the RACs will assign freshmen to the available
          doubles. Requests for a specific roommate will be honored.
          Squatting, however, is not allowed: no freshman will be given
          special consideration for their temporary assignment. Any requests
          based on special circumstances (medical, counseling, or otherwise)
          must come through the housing office and otherwise will not be
          considered at the time of the assignment process. The RACs will try
          to account for requests such as sharing bathrooms with a specific
          gender but cannot guarantee that such an assignment will be
          available.</p>
        <h2>Miscellaneous:</h2>
        <p class="p2">Any situation not covered by this policy should be
          resolved at the discretion of the RACs, who are encouraged to amend
          the policy if this should happen.</p>
        <p class="p2">With the concurrence of the house team, any provision of
          this policy may be set aside under extraordinary circumstances. If
          possible, the RACs should identify and explain any such cases to the
          House Committee.</p>
        <p class="p2">Claiming early sophomore standing will not change one's
          class year for the purposes of housing preferences.</p>
