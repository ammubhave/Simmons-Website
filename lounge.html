        <h1>Lounge Bylaws</h1>
        <ol class="bylaws p2">
          <li>PURPOSE
            <p>Simmons Hall is not conducive to the traditional floor or house
              divisions present in other dorms. Lounges membership is aimed at
              creating smaller in-house groups that will contribute to the over
              all social scene within the dorm.</p>
          </li>
          <li>LOUNGE SETUP
            <ol>
              <li>Lounge social groups become officially recognized upon
                receipt of funding from the house. Official recognition expires
                if it is not renewed by the receipt of more funds at the second
                house committee meeting of each term.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>THE SIGNUP PROCESS
            <ol>
              <li>The lounge committee chair shall be responsible for ensuring
                that the signup process runs smoothly and is effectively
                publicized to the house.</li>
              <li>Lounge signup shall take place via an online form in the
                Simmons Database. The lounge committee chair (with the help of
                a member of the IT committee, if necessary) shall make sure
                this form is set up properly and updated in a timely
                fashion.</li>
              <li>One day prior to the first house committee meeting of the
	        term shall be the new lounge deadline. Lounges not included in
		the online form that submit their information by this deadline
		must be added to the form within four days of the deadline.
		New lounges must submit the following to the lounge committee
		chair:
	        <ol>
		  <li>Lounge social group name</li>
		  <li>Lounge representative</li>
		  <li>Lounge URL (if the group has one)</li>
		  <li>Lounge Blurb: a paragraph representing the social group
		    to be posted online</li>
		  <li>A list of at least 10 usernames of members.</li>
		</ol>
	      </li>
	      <li>One week after the first house committee meeting of the term
	        shall be the membership deadline. At the end of this day, the
		lounge committee chair shall send official membership lists to
		all the lounge representatives.</li>
              <li>Late membership deadlines shall occur one day prior to the
                funding deadline for later house committee meetings. At the end
                of this day, the lounge coordinator need only send official
                membership lists to new lounge representatives.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>MEMBERSHIP AND FUNDING
            <ol>
              <li>Every resident of Simmons Hall is eligible to become a member
                of one lounge of his or her choice during any given term.
                Between the membership deadline and the beginning of the next
                term, lounge members may not join a different lounge.</li>
              <li>To receive funding, a lounge social group must request it
                from the house committee. Only lounge social groups with at
                least ten members and a lounge that meets the requirements of
                Section II are eligible to apply.</li>
              <li>Funding requests from all lounge social groups must be voted
                on at the second house committee meeting of the term. Lounges
                funded at this point will receive $30 in house funds for the
                term per member signed up by the membership deadline.</li>
              <li>If a resident unaffiliated with any lounge joins a lounge
                after the membership deadline but prior to the late membership
                deadline, that lounge may request an additional $25 in house
                funds from the house committee for that term.</li>
              <li>If after the second house committee meeting of the term a
                group of ten or more people wish to start one up, they may
                request $25 from house funds for that term per person signed up
                by the late membership deadline.</li>
              <li>No lounge social group may receive more than $1000 in house
                funds per term no matter how high its membership levels.
                However, the house committee may choose to allocate additional
                funds to specific house-wide proposals (events, trips, etc.)
                from lounge members.</li>
              <li>Funds allocated to a lounge social group one term roll over
                from fall to spring Term, but not spring to fall, provided that
                the lounge social group does not let its official recognition
                expire during the new term.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>LOUNGE GOVERNMENT
            <ol>
              <li>Each lounge must designate one representative to be in charge
                of requesting funding from the house committee and signing
                receipts for submission to the house treasurer. Lounge members
                will not be reimbursed for lounge expenses unless their
                lounge's representative signs their receipts</li>
              <li>The lounge representative shall be selected by an election
                open to all lounge members at the beginning of each term. The
                result of all lounge representative elections must be reported
                to the lounge coordinator by the new lounge deadline.</li>
              <li>At any time during the term, five lounge members may call for
                a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; in their lounge
                representative. If a majority of lounge members vote &quot;no
                confidence,&quot; the lounge representative shall be removed
                from office, and a new election shall be held.</li>
              <li>Other aspects of lounge government (how a budget is agreed
                upon, how voting takes place, etc.) shall be left up to the
                individual lounges.</li>
              <li>The lounge committee chair cannot be the representative of
                any lounge.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>USE OF FUNDS
            <ol>
              <li>Lounge social groups may use lounge funds for events provided
                that all lounge members are aware of this fact at least two
                days in advance. Additionally, the event must be approved by
                the larger of 5 members or 1/3 of the entire group. These
                members do not need to commit to attending the event, but they
                must indicate that they approve of the expenditure. Approval
                shall consist of a record in a publicly archived electronic
                form.</li>
              <li>Trips using lounge funds must be able to accommodate all
                interested members of the lounge. Such trips must be advertised
                to the lounge membership at least two days before the signup
                deadline.</li>
              <li>Lounge social groups may purchase items to be placed in their
                lounge. A lounge social group which purchases capital
                improvements may choose the permanent placement of the purchase
                in a public area. However, any capital improvements shall be
                the property of the house.</li>
              <li>The maximum that a group will be reimbursed for an approved
                event will be the group's per-person allocation times the
                number of members who commit to attending the event.</li>
              <li>Before a lounge expenditure can be reimbursed it must be
                reported on the Simmons DB and the lounge coordinator must
                verify the event was in compliance with the lounge bylaws. The
                report to the Simmons DB must include a description of the
                event, the amount spend, and the number of lounge members in
                attendance.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>FIRST TIME CAVEAT
            <p>To make up for lost time, all lounges people are interested in
              starting shall be funded $300, effective as soon as ten members
              sign up. Lounges may request funding for additional members at
              the $30 level at the house committee meeting directly following
              the one at which this document is approved. For funding purposes,
              that meeting shall function like the second house committee
              meeting of the term.</p>
