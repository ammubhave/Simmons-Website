    <h2>Simmons Hall - House Tax Proposal - Fall 2014</h2>
    <img src="img/Slide1.jpg" />
    <p class="text">
      First, it may surprise folks to discover that our house tax is among the <b>lowest taxes on
      campus</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="img/Slide2.jpg" />
    <p class="text">
      The House Tax was initially set to $75, and then lowered to $65 in 2009. <b>Lackluster
      involvement at the time meant the House was running a surplus</b>. The proposal, presented as a
      humorous play on the then-ongoing financial crisis, was just for one year. Evidently, for
      whatever reason, it was never changed back.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      In recent years, <b>House participation has surged</b>. An overwhelming majority of residents join
      lounges. There is tremendous enthusiasm toward submitting proposals. There are no officer
      vacancies, and few uncontested elections. Our high-profile events include one of the most
      popular REX/CPW line-ups on campus.
      <br /><br />
      But, <b>the purchasing power of the House has eroded by almost a third</b> due to inflation alone.
    </p>

    <img src="img/Slide4.jpg" />
    <p class="text">
      To make matters worse, much of Simmonsâ€™s revenue (taxes multiplied by population) is <b>allocated
      to Lounges and other fixed costs.</b> Compared to similar dorms, our $30/person appropriation to
      Lounges is unique.
      <br /><br />
      While lounges are an integral part of what makes Simmons special, this unfortunately leaves
      our operating budget (the money left for proposals) <b>strikingly scanty</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="img/Slide5.jpg" />
    <p class="text">
      This is particularly concerning in light of the fact that, in just the first two House
      Meetings, we have <b>allocated almost our entire operating budget for the year.</b>
    </p>

    <img src="img/Slide6.jpg" />
    <p class="text">
      This is not cause for immediate alarm. Allocating funding does not mean it all will be spent,
      and <b>we have significant reserves</b> (approximately $29,000 at the start of this year) accumulated
      from many years ago, which we can tap into.
      <br /><br />
      However, unless we want to start voting down genuinely good proposals out of austerity, we
      need to address the reality that, as it stands, we <b>simply do not have enough revenue to sustain
      all the amazing things that we collectively want to do as a dorm.</b> If we value being able to
      independently build a community that is uniquely our own, one that reflects our playful and
      enthusiastic culture, we must make this a priority.
    </p>

    <img src="img/Slide7.jpg" />
    <p class="text">
      If approved, this modest change would <b>nearly double our operating budget</b> for general
      proposals, and put us upper-middle of the pack, between the aforementioned Maseeh and Next
      House. The change would take effect next term.
