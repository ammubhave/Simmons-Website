        <ol class="bylaws p2">
          <li>The Reservation Chair will deal with public space
            reservations.  Public spaces are found on the first floor
            and east side of the second floor.  Specifically, the
            reservation chair will coordinate reservations of the
            multi-purpose Room (MPR), dining room, conference room,
            2nd floor study area, Athena lounge, mailbox lounge, night
            caf&eacute; lounge, and kitchen.

                reservations in the night caf&eacute; lounge during
                operating times.</li>
	      <li>Catering by Simmons Dining or the night caf&eacute;
                business should be encouraged, especially if the event
                uses the dining hall or night caf&eacute; area.</li>
	    </ol></li>
	  <li>Reservations will be taken from the following types of
	    groups and approved by the indicated party.

                in which case the House Committee.</li>
	      <li>MIT group with many non-MIT attendees: Reservation
                Chair unless the event is large or long, in which case
                the House Committee.</li>

		</ol></li>

	    </ol>
	    <p>* Large means more than 49 people.  Long means more
	       than 4 hours.<br />
	       ** MIT attendees must have a close affiliation with MIT
	       (e.g., students, alumni, staff, and faculty).</p></li>
           <li>Advance reservations
	    <ol>
	      <li>Events organized by official MIT groups (e.g.,
	        alumni organization, administration) and Simmons
	        government or house-team member sponsored events can
	        be made up to one year in advance.</li>
	      <li>Simmons groups can begin to make reservations for
	        fall semester May 1st, IAP November 1st, and spring
	        semester December 1st.</li>
	      <li>All other groups can begin to request spaces up to 6
	        weeks in advance of the next academic term.</li>
	      <li>Requests for events not open to all Simmons
	        residents must be received at least a week before the
	        event.</li>
	      <li>Reservations must be received and approved at least
	        48 hours before the event.  However, spontaneous use
	        (see below) may be possible.</li>
	    </ol></li>
	  <li>Spontaneous use
            <ol>
	      <li>Individuals and groups (less than 50 people) led by
	        a Simmons resident who will be present throughout the
	        event can use any of the available reservable spaces.
	        Larger spontaneous events should be coordinated by
	        Simmons house members and aimed at Simmons
	        residents.</li>
	      <li>First come, first served.  Residents should work out
	        any conflicts on their own.</li>
	      <li>If damage occurs and a responsible party can be
	        determined, fines may be issued.</li>
	    </ol></li>
	  <li>Prohibited reservation times
	    <ol>
	      <li>Reservation requests for events that take place
	        during campus preview weekend, Rush, REX, or freshman
	        orientation should be rejected unless they are FOR
	        these programs.</li>
	      <li>Reservation requests for events that take place
	        during finals should be rejected unless they are
	        finals or study-break oriented and only for Simmons
	        residents.</li>
	      <li>Reservations for the dining hall should be rejected
	        if they interfere with student dining hours.</li>
	      <li>No loud events should take place between the hours
	        of 1 AM and 10 AM.</li>
	      <li>House meetings have priority Sunday evenings 9-10:30
	        PM.</li>
	    </ol></li>
	  <li>Fees and forms 
	    <ol>
	      <li>Costs related to setup/breakdown labor,
	        housekeeping, and damages will be charged to the
	        responsible person or group by the Simmons Hall House
	        Manager.</li>
	      <li>Income from bookings will be placed in the House
	        Committee account.</li>
	      <li>The fee structure will be laid out in <a
	        href="resfees.html">another document</a> and can be
	        modified by majority vote in the House Committee.</li>
	      <li>A Simmons Hall Space Reservation Application needs
	        to be completed and delivered to the reservation chair
	        before an event takes place if the event is registered
	        through MIT, the group is paying a fee, there is a
	        moderate risk of damage, or the reservation chair
	        wants a written agreement.  If no MIT account number
	        is available, a deposit of $200 is required.</li>
	      <li>If MIT registration is required, the group must
	        complete this process before the event.</li>
	    </ol></li>
	  <li>Notices
	    <ol>
	      <li>A list of reservations should be posted online and
	        at desk.  Reasonable effort should be made to ensure
	        that the notices are current.</li>
	    </ol></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="p2">These are guidelines and will not cover every
          eventuality.  The Reservation Chair and Committee should use
          their best judgment or consult the House Committee when
          these bylaws are insufficient.</p>
