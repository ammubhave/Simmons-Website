            <p>For decades at MIT, dormitory communities have been developing
              sophisticated systems of self-governance. These systems are
              entirely student-built and student-run, and they have received
              very little support or interference from the MIT administration.
              Despite or because of this (you be the judge), these governance
              systems have developed quite well.</p>
            <p>According to the MIT administration, Simmons Hall is intended to
              signal a change from the current standards of dorm life. This is
              largely true. However, the governance of Simmons Hall will not be
              a change away from the self-governance model, but formalization
              and strengthening of it. The Simmons Hall governance model is
              intended to allow the dorm to have more independence and a
              stronger voice in the decisions that affect it. Moreover, it is
              intended to better define the relationship of Housemasters and
              Graduate Resident Tutors to the governance process, encouraging
              their participation and support but ensuring that they do not
              assume control over governance functions.</p>
            <p>The Simmons Hall governance model is also founded on the concept
              of the House as an entity that is more than just a building, and
              more than simply the sum of its residents. All residents are
              supported by the House physically and socially. Reciprocally, the
              House requires support from all of its residents. This House
              model works on several basic principles:</p>
            <p>Principle 1: All residents have an implicit responsibility to
              the House. There is not a select group of people who handle all
              the functions of House governance, and whom you can blame if dorm
              life is not what you want it to be. It is up to everyone. If you
              want Simmons Hall to be a good place, you have to get involved
              and make it that way. If you think Simmons Hall sucks, then
              there's no one you can blame but yourself.</p>
            <p>Principle 2: There are varying levels of responsibility to
              choose from. You can run for an elected Office, or volunteer to
              serve on a Committee, or show up to House Committee meetings, or
              on the most basic level, have respect for the House and for your
              fellow residents. Define your responsibility as you like. Teach
              the freshman next door how to do an 8.01 problem. Start your own
              Committee, or initiate a project that will make the House more
              interesting. Throw a House-wide party &mdash; making sure that
              you do not cause harm to the House or its residents.</p>
            <p>Principle 3: The House speaks for the House. When the House
              makes a decision, it is explicit that the decision was made
              through a democratic process that involves all House residents.
              There are no representatives who &quot;call the shots&quot; for
              everyone.</p>
            <p>Principle 4: If you do not like something, change it. While
              traditions are important to building culture, the House should
              not keep doing something simply because people did it the year
              before, and other people did it the year before that. Times keep
              changing and the House should keep thinking creatively and coming
              up with new ways to improve House life.</p>
            <p>Principle 5: The House has a responsibility to improve campus
              life at MIT. The residential communities are among the strongest,
              if not the strongest, social groups at MIT. Any semblance of a
              campus-wide community is most likely to start in the residential
              communities. Simmons Hall needs to work towards creating ties to
              other dorm communities on all parts of campus, as well as the
              FSILG community, graduate students, alumni, faculty and even
              administrators. What does this all really have to do with House
              governance, you might ask? Really, not much. But keep it in
              mind.</p>
            <p>Principle 6: House governance should be part of the educational
              experience for all residents. Students and faculty alike should
              feel that they learned something from being an active member of
              the House. They should also feel that they had some degree of
              fun, and that their educational experience was better because
              they had a release from the rigor of MIT academics and
              research.</p>
            <p>This is the philosophy behind the governance of Simmons
              Hall.</p>

                    to the collective residents and communities residing within
                    the Simmons Hall dormitory of the Massachusetts Institute
                    of Technology, located at 229 Vassar Street in Cambridge,
                    Massachusetts. When Simmons Hall is mentioned in this
                    document, unless otherwise mentioned, it is in reference to
                    the House and not only the building.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>This document is the Constitution of Simmons Hall. The
                    purpose of the Constitution is: (a) to establish the
                    overall model for governance of the House; (b) to define
                    the roles of some of the individuals and groups who are
                    involved in the governance of the House; (c) to define some
                    of the procedures that guide the proper functioning of
                    House governance.</li>
                  <li>House Policies supplement the Constitution in guiding
                    House governance, and may be created and revised
                    continually over time. House Policies may include, but are
                    not limited to, the policy on room assignments, policies on
                    the use of House facilities and House funds, rules of
                    conduct such as quiet hours or regulations on the use of
                    alcohol, policies that establish the roles and
                    responsibilities of new House governance groups or
                    positions, and policies that define or clarify House
                    governance procedures.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>The House, through its governance mechanisms, makes many
                    decisions that impact all its residents. It raises House
                    funds and uses those funds towards House-shared resources
                    and events. It defines House Policies that ensure the
                    well-being of all House residents. It also, at times,
                    expresses collective House opinions. The governance of
                    Simmons Hall is established on the principle that when an
                    issue affects all residents, all residents should have a
                    voice in making a decision on that issue. The House
                    Committee is the central mechanism by which the House makes
                    the types of decisions described in this paragraph.</li>

                 <ol>
                   <li>The House Committee, by collective action, makes all
                     major house-wide decisions and expresses the official
                     opinion of Simmons Hall on any matter of interest to the
                     residents of Simmons Hall.</li>
                   <li>The House Committee is responsible for: (a) establishing
                     House Policies, and making changes to standing House
                     Policies and to the Constitution; (b) allocating House
                     funds to be used towards House-shared resources and
                     events; (c) creating or adopting new residential programs
                     that will result in major changes to the House; (d)
                     discussing any issue of relevance to Simmons Hall or to
                     MIT at large, and approving any resolution expressing the
                     official opinion of the residents of Simmons Hall on any
                     such issue; (e) discussing and deciding upon items
                     presented to it by any individual House Committee Member
                     or group of House Committee Members; (f) overseeing the
                     activity of all Committees, Subcommittees and House
                     Offices.</li>

                     and announced to all Members of the House Committee.
                     Meetings of the House Committee occur at least once within

                     Committee meeting.</li>
                   <li>Proposals are approved by a majority vote yes, with the
                     exception that proposals for Constitutional Amendments
                     require a two-thirds majority vote for approval.</li>
                   <li>Proposals are moved-to-full-forum by a greater than
                     one-third vote yes. A motion to move-to-full-forum takes
                     precedence over a motion to approve. When a proposal is
                     moved-to-full-forum, the house secretary should create a
                     description of the issue of contention with input from one
                     or more proponents and opponents. The secretary would then
                     publicly post the description and issue a full house
                     ballot on the issue to be concluded before the next house
                     meeting. The results of this vote would be final. (Note:
                     In implementation, this would mean posting the issue to
                     Simmons' official or other public mailing lists, and the
                     vote could be issued on the Simmons database.)</li>
                   <li>Proposals are deferred by a majority vote yes. A motion
                     to defer takes precedence over a motion to
                     move-to-full-forum and a motion to approve. When a
                     proposal is deferred, it is tabled for a two week period
                     until the next house meeting.</li>
		   <li>The fraction of votes required to pass any motion
		     brought before the House Committee is to be taken as a
		     fraction of those electing to vote on the motion. Any
		     members of the House Committee who are not present or who
		     choose to abstain shall not be included in the count of
		     the total number of votes.</li>

                   <li>Many of the functions performed by the House Committee
                     require that constant attention is paid to specific
                     topics. For each of these specific topics, it may be
                     appropriate to establish a Committee of the House.
                     Committees focus on specific issues and make
                     recommendations to the House Committee. In addition,
                     Committees oversee and manage the implementation of House
                     Policies and particular House activities, events, and
                     programs.</li>

                 <ol>
                   <li>A Committee is a group of House Committee members who
                     collectively focus on particular sets of issues of
                     importance to residents of Simmons Hall. Committees may be
                     established on a Standing or Ad-Hoc basis.</li>
                   <li>An Ad-Hoc Committee for any purpose may be convened by
                     the Chair of the House Committee or by virtue of a
                     majority vote of the House Committee.</li>
                   <li>Any Standing Committee must be formed by action of the
                     House Committee in the form of an amendment to this
                     Constitution and included in the following section.</li>
                   <li>Eleven Committees of the House are defined in the
		     Simmons Hall Constitution. These Committees are: (a) the
                     Facilities Committee; (b) the Technology Committee; (c)
                     the Dining Committee; (d) the Rush Committee; (e) the
                     Social Committee; (f) the Reservations Committee; (g) the
                     Athletics Committee; (h) the Lounge Committee; (i) the
		     Workshop Committee; (j) the Movie Committee; (k) the
		     Electrical Engineering Lab Committee. These Committees
		     must exist at all times. The roles and responsibilities
		     of these Committees are stated in this Article of the
		     Simmons Hall Constitution.</li>
                   <li>Each Committee must have one or two Chair(s), who are
                     responsible for: (a) maintaining a Committee membership
                     list; (b) scheduling and facilitating meetings of the
                     Committee; (c) reporting on the activities of the
                     Committee at House Committee meetings. If the Chair(s)
                     fail to report at House Committee meetings, the Chair of
                     the House Committee may choose either: (a) to allow the
                     remaining Committee members to elect a new Chair(s); (b)
                     to appoint a new Chair(s); (c) to dissolve the
                     Committee.</li>
                   <li>The House Committee elects one or two individuals to
                     serve one-year terms as Chairs of each of the Committees
                     of the House defined in Article II, Paragraph 2.4 of the
                     Simmons Hall Constitution. Regular elections for House
                     Subcommittee Chairs are held at the end of each fall
                     semester. These Chairs are considered House Offices and
                     adhere to the provisions of Article VII of the Simmons
                     Hall Constitution.</li>
                   <li>Membership on any Committee of the House must be open to
                     all Members of the House Committee. A Member of the House
                     Committee may join a Committee by contacting the Committee
                     Chair or the Chair of the House Committee and asking to be
                     added to the membership list.</li>
                   <li>If a Committee member fails to report to meetings or
                     otherwise fails to carry out the responsibilities required
                     of the individual by that Committee, the Committee Chair
                     may choose to remove that individual from the membership
                     of the Committee.</li>

                   <li>All business of each Committee is discussed at meetings
                     that are open and announced to all members of the
                     Committee, and preferably announced to all Members of the
                     House Committee. Committees may also encourage discussion
                     outside of meetings, for instance over e-mail lists. All
                     modes of discussion must allow for participation from all
                     members of the Committee.</li>
                   <li>Committee meetings should be held at appropriate times
                     given the particular topic of the Committee's attention.
                     Committee meetings should typically occur once each month,
                     unless there is no business to be discussed at that
                     time.</li>
                   <li>An official statement presented by a Committee to the
                     House Committee or to any other group internal or external
                     to the House is considered a decision. Decisions may
                     include, but are not limited to, event plans, funding
                     proposals, and proposed policies.</li>
                   <li>Committees make decisions by group consensus or by
                     majority vote. No decisions are made until after the full
                     membership of the Committee is given a chance to comment
                     or vote. Committee decisions are reported to the House
                     Committee by the Committee Chair. If any member of a
                     Committee disputes a decision reported by the Committee
                     Chair, the Chair of the House Committee may call a vote of
                     the Committee membership, or refer the complaint to the
                     Judicial Committee.</li>

                     Committee's purview. These Subcommittees shall have the
                     same flexibility to act and create policy as a full
                     Committee, however any decision of a Subcommittee is
                     subject to the approval of the full Committee of which it
                     is a part.</li>
                   <li>A Subcommittee of any existing full Committee may be
                     established by a majority vote of the House Committee.
                     Subcommittees may be established on an Ad-Hoc or Standing
                     basis.</li>
                   <li>The Chairs of Subcommittees are not considered full
                     House Officers and as such do not fall under the purview

                    Uniform Judicial Code for Undergraduate Dormitories; (h)
                    communicating regularly with the Dormitory Council Judicial
                    Committee and the MIT Office of Conflict Management and
                    Discipline; (i) reporting regularly to the House
                    Committee.</li>
                  <li>At the end of each fall semester, the House Committee
                    elects two individuals from the freshman class to serve as
                    Judicial Committee Officers. Elected Judicial Officers may
                    serve until they resign or until they are no longer
                    official residents of Simmons Hall. If a Judicial Office
                    not belonging to a member of the senior class is vacant,
                    the House Committee elects a new member from the same class
                    year as the resigned member. At all times the Judicial
                    Committee consists of at least six members, two from each
                    undergraduate class, along with any spring-term seniors or
                    super-seniors who choose to remain in service.</li>
                  <li>The Judicial Committee elects one of its own Officers to 
                    serve as Chair, and may elect to replace the Chair whenever
                    it deems appropriate. The Chair is responsible for managing
                    and facilitating all business of the Committee, including
                    scheduling meetings and hearings, and speaking before the
                    House Committee.</li>
                  <li>The Judicial Committee has its own bylaws, which outline
                    all its responsibilities and the steps of its
                    disciplinary/hearing procedures. All members of the
                    Judicial Committee must abide by these bylaws. The bylaws
                    are derived from the dormitory judicial board requirements
                    of MIT.</li>

                  <li>Only undergraduate members of the House Committee are
                    eligible to serve as Officers. No individual may hold more
                    than one Office simultaneously.</li>
                  <li>New officers take office during the first meeting of the
                    spring term. Outgoing officers have the responsibility of
                    handing over turnover files to the incoming officers.
                    Outgoing officers also have the responsibility of helping
                    to run the first meeting of the spring term.</li>
                  <li>All elections must be open to all Members of the House
                    Committee, whether or not they are able to attend House
                    Committee meetings, and must use preferential voting
                    methods where applicable.</li>
                  <li>The election process is overseen by the Elections
		    Organizer.  By default, the Elections Organizer is the
		    Chair of the House Committee.  However, if the Chair of
		    the House Committee intends to be a candidate in the
		    election or otherwise wishes not to be Elections
		    Organizer, the Chair must select another undergraduate
		    member of the House Committee (who must not intend to be
		    a candidate) to be the Elections Organizer. This
		    selection must by approved by a simple majority vote of
		    the House Committee. The selection of Elections Organizer
		    must occur before the beginning of nominations.  The
		    Elections Organizer cannot be nominated to be a
		    candidate.  The Judicial Committee hears all complaints
		     related to the fairness of the election procedure.</li> 
                  <li>An Office becomes vacant when the individual holding that
                    Office resigns or is no longer an official resident of
                    Simmons Hall. An Officer may resign by informing the Chair
                    of the House Committee of one's resignation, or the Chair
                    of the House Committee may assume that an Officer has
                    resigned if that Officer fails to communicate with the
                    House Committee or otherwise fails to undertake the
                    responsibilities of that Office.</li>
                  <li>Nominations for house officer positions will occur during
                    the house meeting preceding elections (second from end of
                    fall term). A nominee will be placed on the ballot if their
                    name is mentioned and seconded. People can nominate
                    themselves and nominate multiple times. One can be
                    nominated by proxy, including by the house chair. The chair
                    must nominate anyone who notified him/her by two days
                    before the house meeting.</li>
                  <li>House meetings are currently bi-weekly. During the
                    interim week between the nomination meeting and the final
                    meeting of the term, we will hold a special election
                    meeting. During this meeting, all candidates will be given
                    three minutes to present their platform and one minute to
                    answer questions. A further several minutes will be
                    dedicated to questioning any/all of the candidates for a
                    particular office. Proxies may read the platform of missing
                    candidates, but may not take part in the question answering
                    sessions. This meeting should be heavily publicized to
                    increase turnout.</li>
                  <li>If a house officer position becomes vacant mid-term, the
                    resigning officer should be reminded of his/her duty to
                    train the replacement. The chair of the house committee
                    should notify the house that the spot has become vacant and
                    that they may demonstrate interest within the week. At the
                    end of the week, one of two outcomes has occurred: (a) 1 or
                    0 people have contacted the chair. In this case, the chair
                    is permitted to appoint said person (if one is found) to
                    the office in question. The chair must ratify the selection
                    at the next house committee meeting with a simple majority
                    vote; (b) 2 or more people have contacted the chair. In
                    this case, the chair (with the help of other officers) must
                    administer a one-week mid-term election for the house to
                    select between the candidates. Additionally, if the end of
                    the one-week special election would fall within one month
                    of the end of a regular election, then the house chair may
                    exercise his/her discretion in deciding whether to run a
                    vote/ appoint directly/ wait for the main election.</li>
                  <li>Provisionally elected Officers take Office immediately
                    upon election and fill the vacant Office until the time of
                    the next regular election.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Any member or group of members of the House Committee may
                    propose an Article of Impeachment against an Officer, if
                    that member or group feels that: (a) the Officer is
                    neglecting the responsibilities of that Office; (b) the
                    Officer is abusing the authority granted to that Office;
                    (c) the Officer is not acting in the interest of the House.
                    A proposed Article of Impeachment must include an
                    explanation that addresses at least one of these three
                    points.</li>
                  <li>A proposed Article of Impeachment is placed on the House
                    Committee agenda, discussed, and voted upon in the same
                    manner as is any other item of House Committee
                    business.</li>
                  <li>If the Chair of the House Committee is the object of the
                    Article of Impeachment, the Secretary of the House
                    Committee assumes the responsibilities of the Chair for all
                    business relating to the Article of Impeachment.</li>
                  <li>If an Article of Impeachment is approved by a House
		    Committee vote, the Chair of the House Committee holds a
		    hearing open to all Members of the House Committee. The
		    proponent of the Article of Impeachment, the object of the
		    Article of Impeachment, and the Chair of the House
		    Committee are given the opportunity to speak at this
		    hearing, and may invite witnesses to speak on their
		    behalf, but any witness may be dismissed by the Chair of
		    the House Committee on the grounds of irrelevance. No
		    other individuals are allowed to speak at this
		    hearing.</li>
		  <li>The Chair of the House Committee may decide, based on
		    the evidence presented at the hearing, to remove an
		    individual from Office if and only if: (a) the information
		    presented in the Article of Impeachment is truthful in
		    content; and (b) the Article of Impeachment sufficiently
		    explains why the impeached individual should be removed
		    from Office. After deliberation, the Chair of the House
		    Committee presents the decision, along with a written
		    explanation, to the House.</li>
                  <li>The decision of the Judicial Committee to remove an
                    individual from Office may be appealed to the Dormitory
                    Council Judicial Committee, as described in Article V of
                    the Uniform Judicial Code for Undergraduate
                    Dormitories.</li>
                  <li>If an Officer of the Judicial Committee is the object of
                    an Article of Impeachment, that Officer is suspended from
                    Office at the time the House Committee approves the Article
                    of Impeachment. If the remaining members of the Judicial
                    Committee decide against the Article of Impeachment, the
                    impeached Officer is fully reinstated to the Judicial
                    Committee effective immediately upon receipt of the
                    decision.</li>
                  <li>An Office that is unoccupied as the result of impeachment
                    proceedings is then treated in the same manner as any other
                    vacancy, except that the removed Officer is no longer

                <ol>
                  <li>MIT specially selects some individuals to live in Simmons
                    Hall in order to ensure the health, safety and well-being
                    of House residents and to promote a vibrant and diverse
                    social life within the House. These include Housemasters
                    and Graduate Resident Tutors (GRTs), and may also include
                    Visiting Scholars, Residential Life Associates, or others.
                    Along with the House Manager and staff, these individuals
                    collectively form a House Support Team, with the
                    Housemaster serving as its head, that operates
                    independently of the House Committee but must remain in
                    contact with the House Committee in order to ensure a
                    mutually supportive working relationship.</li>
                  <li>Housemasters, GRTs, and any other individuals who are
                    specially selected by MIT to live in Simmons Hall are all
                    considered Members of the House Committee, but do not have
                    any official standing within the House Committee, nor do
                    they have any official responsibilities to the House
                    Committee. Nonetheless, they are encouraged to participate
                    in all activities of the House Committee, and to offer
                    their support to the House Committee where the House would
                    benefit from the specialized assistance they may be able to
                    provide.</li>

              </li>
              <li id="VIII.2">The Housemaster Role
                <ol>
                  <li>The Simmons Hall Housemaster team consists of the
                    Housemasters and Associate Housemasters, who are faculty
                    members living with their families in Simmons Hall. The
                    Housemasters and Associate Housemasters are appointed to
                    their positions by the Office of the Dean for Student Life.
                    They are expected to integrate fully into the House and to
                    support the entire House socially and intellectually.</li>
                  <li>The Housemaster role in the House falls into four areas:
                    (a) They hold frequent social events, and participate
                    actively in the social events held by House residents, in
                    order to get to know as many undergraduates as possible;
                    (b) they help House residents deal with problems, ranging
                    from inter-personal or inter-group issues to those of a
                    highly personal and individual nature, including but not
                    limited to difficulties with academics, personal stress
                    brought upon by relationships, difficulty dealing with the
                    pace and pressure of MIT, and medical problems; (c) they
                    supervise the Graduate Resident Tutors; (d) they report to
                    the rest of the MIT faculty and to the MIT
                    administration.</li>
                  <li>When a new Housemaster or Associate Housemaster must be
                    selected, a House Subcommittee is formed to review
                    candidates and make recommendations to the Dean for Student
                    Life.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li id="VIII.3">The Graduate Resident Tutor Role
                <ol>
                  <li>Graduate Resident Tutors are MIT graduate students hired
                    by the Office of the Dean for Student Life to live in
                    Simmons Hall, sometimes along with partners or families.
                    They are expected to integrate fully into the House and to
                    provide support to a specific set of House residents living
                    in a particular area of the building.</li>
                  <li>The GRT role in the House falls into four areas: (a) They
                    serve as advisors and mentors to House residents,
                    particularly those living within their area; (b) they
                    respond to crises and conflicts that occur within the
                    House, relying on their training and judgment; (c) they
                    serve as advocates for the interests of students, as
                    liaisons between students and Housemasters, and sometimes
                    as liaisons between students and the administration; (d)
                    they serve as community facilitators, encouraging
                    interaction and providing recreational opportunities for
                    House residents, particularly those living within their
                    area.</li>
                  <li>The GRT role in the House expressly excludes any
                    disciplinary component. Only the Judicial Committee or the
                    Housemasters may officially recommend disciplinary action
                    against a resident of Simmons Hall.</li>
                  <li>When new GRTs must be hired to fill open positions in
                    Simmons Hall, a House Subcommittee, including members of
                    the Housemaster team, is formed to review all candidates
                    and provide a list of recommended candidates to the Office
                    of the Dean for Student Life.</li>

                    the House Committee. However, the House Committee may
                    establish House Policies regarding the roles these
                    individuals are expected to play in the House. Live-in
                    roles as defined by the House Committee must complement,
                    and must not contradict, the roles as defined by the MIT

                    Hall may include the House Manager, staff serving under the
                    House Manager, the dining hall staff, and others. These
                    individuals are not considered Members of the House

                    support to the House Committee where the House would
                    benefit from the specialized assistance they may be able to

                    from the use of house funds.</li>
                  <li>All proposals made to the house committee should have an
                    explicit time-frame built in. This is especially important
                    so that treasurers do not need to maintain logs
                    indefinitely of approved, allocated money that has never
                    been spent. The &quot;default&quot; expiration of
                    allocations (i.e. those that do not specify otherwise) will
                    be at the end of the term in which the money was intended
                    to be spent, or at the end of the current term if no
                    intended date is specified.</li>

                    residents of Simmons Hall. The residents of Simmons Hall
                    have made certain changes to reflect the first year of
                    Simmons' existence. The residents have also chosen to
                    ratify this Constitution with a two-thirds vote, following
                    a consensus from the House that the voting method is
                    appropriate.</li>
